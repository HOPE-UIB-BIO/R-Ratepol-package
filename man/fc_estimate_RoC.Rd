\description{
A function to estimate Rate of change in community data in time series
}
\details{
R-Ratepol is written as an R package and includes a range of
possible settings including a novel method to evaluate RoC in a single
stratigraphical sequence using assemblage data and age uncertainties for
each level. There are multiple built-in dissimilarity coefficients (DC) for
different types of assemblage data, and various levels of data smoothing
that can be applied depending on the type and variance of the data.
In addition, R-Ratepol can use randomisation, accompanied by use of age
uncertainties of each level and taxon standardisation to detect RoC patterns
in datasets with high data noise or variability (i.e. numerous rapid changes
in composition or sedimentation rates).

The computation of RoC in R-Ratepol is performed using the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Assemblage and age-model data are extracted from the original source and
should be compiled together, i.e. depth, age, variable (taxon) 1, variable (taxon) 2, etc.
\item (optional) Smoothing of assemblage data: Each variable within the
assemblage data is smoothed using one of five in-built smoothing methods:
\itemize{
\item none (\code{smooth_method} = \code{"none"})
\item Shepard's 5-term filter (\code{smooth_method} = \code{"shep"}; Davis, 1986; Wilkinson, 2005)
\item moving average ´(\code{smooth_method} = \verb{"m.avg"\}})
\item age-weighted average (\code{smooth_method} = \code{"age.w"})
\item Grimm's smoothing (\code{smooth_method} = \code{"grim"}; Grimm and Jacobson, 1992)
}
\item Creation of time bins: A template for all time bins in all window movements is created.
\item A single run (an individual loop) is computed:
\itemize{
\item (optional) Selection of one time series from age uncertainties (see section on randomisation)
\item Subsetting levels in each bin: Here the working units (WU) are defined
\item (optional) Standardisation of assemblage data in each WU
\item The summary of a single run is produced based on all moving windows
\item Calculation of RoC between WUs: RoC is calculated as the dissimilarity
coefficient (DC) standardised by age differences between WUs. Five in-built
dissimilarity coefficients are available:
\itemize{
\item Euclidean distance (\code{DC} = \code{"euc"})
\item standardised Euclidean distance (\code{DC} = \code{"euc.sd"})
\item Chord distance (\code{DC} = \code{"chord"})
\item Chi-squared coefficient (\code{DC} = \code{"chisq"}; Prentice, 1980)
\item Gower's distance (\code{DC} = \code{"gower"};Gower, 1971)
\item Bray-Curtis distance (\code{DC} = \code{"bray"})
}
The choice of DC depends on the type of assemblage data. In addition, RoC
between WUs be calculated using every consecutive WU (\code{only_subsequent} = \code{FALSE}),
or alternatively, calculation of RoC can be restricted to only directly
adjacent WUs (\code{only_subsequent} = \code{TRUE}). Using the former increases
the number of samples for which RoC can be calculated within a sequence,
which varies in terms of sample resolution, but may still introduce
biases related to the RoC estimation as a result of the varying
inter-sample distances.
}
\item Step 4 is repeated multiple times (e.g. 10,000 times).
\item Validation and summary of results from all runs of RoC calculation are produced.
\item (Optional) Data beyond a certain age can be excluded.
}
\subsection{Selection of working units (WU; Step 3)}{

RoC is calculated between consecutive Working Units (WU). Traditionally,
these WUs represent individual stratigraphical levels. However, changes in
sedimentation rates and sampling strategies can result in an uneven temporal
distribution of levels within a time sequence, which in turn makes
the comparison of RoC between sequences problematic. There are various methods
that attempt to minimise such problems. The first is interpolation of levels
to evenly spaced time intervals, and the use of the interpolated data as WUs.
This can lead to a loss of information when the density of levels is high.
Second is binning of levels: assemblage data are pooled into age brackets
of various size (i.e. time bins) and these serve as WUs. Here, the issue
is a lower resolution of WUs and their uneven size in terms of total
assemblage count (bins with more levels have higher assemblage counts).
Third is selective binning: like classical binning, bins of selected size
are created, but instead of pooling assemblage data together, only one
level per time bin is selected as representative of each bin. This results
in an even number of WUs in bins with a similar count size in the assemblage.
However, the issue of low resolution remains.
Therefore, we propose a new method of binning with a moving window,
which is a compromise between using individual levels and selective binning.
This method follows a simple sequence: time bins are created,
levels are selected as in selective binning, and RoC between bins is calculated.
However, the brackets of the time bin (window) are then moved forward by a
selected amount of time (Z), levels are selected again (subset into bins),
and RoC calculated for the new set of WUs. This is repeated X times
(where X is the bin size divided by Z) while retaining all the results.

R-Ratepol currently provides several options for selecting WU, namely as i
ndividual levels (\code{Working_Units} = \code{"levels"}), selective binning of levels
(\code{Working_Units} = \code{"bins"}), and our new method of binning with a moving
window (\code{Working_Units} = \code{"MW"})
}

\subsection{Randomisation}{

Due to the inherent statistical errors in uncertainties in the age estimates
from age-depth and the assemblage datasets (e.g. pollen counts in each level;
Birks and Gordon, 1985), R-Ratepol can be run several times and the results
summarised (Steps 5-6). Therefore, two optional settings are available by
using age uncertainties and assemblage data standardisation.
}

\subsection{Age uncertainties}{

For each run, a single age sequence from the age uncertainties is randomly
selected. The calculation between two consecutive WUs (i.e. one working-unit
combination) results in a RoC score and a time position (which is calculated
as the mean age position of the two WUs). However, due to random sampling
of the age sequence, each WU combination will result in multiple RoC values.
The final RoC value for a single WU combination is calculated as the median
of the scores from all randomisations. In addition, the 95th quantile from all
randomisations is calculated as an error estimate.
}

\subsection{Data standardisation (Step 4b)}{

Taxa in the assemblage dataset can be standardised to a certain count
(e.g. number of pollen grains in each WU) by rarefaction. Random sampling
without replacement is used to draw a selected number of individuals from
each WU (e.g. 150 pollen grains).
