\title{Calculate the dissimilarity coeficient}
\usage{
fc_calculate_DC(data_source_DC, DC = "chord", verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_source_DC}{Data.frame with taxons as columns}

\item{DC}{Character. Dissimilarity coefficient. Type of calculation of differences
between Working Units. See \code{vegan::vegdist} for more details.
\itemize{
\item \code{"euc"} - Euclidean distance
\item \code{"euc.sd"} - Standardised Euclidean distance
\item \code{"chord"} - Chord distance
\item \code{"chisq"} - Chi-squared coefficient
\item \code{"gower"} - Gower's distance
\item \code{"bray"} - Bray-Curtis distance
}}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, function will output messages about internal processes}
}
\description{
Calculate the dissimilarity coeficient
}
\details{
Five in-built dissimilarity coefficients are available:
\itemize{
\item Euclidean distance (\code{DC} = \code{"euc"})
\item standardised Euclidean distance (\code{DC} = \code{"euc.sd"})
\item Chord distance (\code{DC} = \code{"chord"})
\item Chi-squared coefficient (\code{DC} = \code{"chisq"})
\item Gower's distance (\code{DC} = \code{"gower"})
\item Bray-Curtis distance (\code{DC} = \code{"bray"})
}
The choice of DC depends on the type of assemblage data. In addition, RoC
between WUs be calculated using every consecutive WU (\code{only_subsequent} = \code{FALSE}),
or alternatively, calculation of RoC can be restricted to only directly
adjacent WUs (\code{only_subsequent} = \code{TRUE}). Using the former increases
the number of samples for which RoC can be calculated within a sequence,
which varies in terms of sample resolution, but may still introduce
biases related to the RoC estimation as a result of the varying
inter-sample distances.
