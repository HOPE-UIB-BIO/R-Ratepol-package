Traditionally, WUs represent individual stratigraphical levels. However, changes sedimentation rates sampling strategies can result uneven temporal distribution levels within time sequence, turn makes comparison RoC sequences problematic. various methods attempt minimise problems. first interpolation levels evenly spaced time intervals, use interpolated data WUs. can lead loss information density levels high. Second binning levels: assemblage data pooled age brackets various size (.e. time bins) serve WUs. , issue lower resolution WUs uneven size terms total assemblage count (bins levels higher assemblage counts). Third selective binning: like classical binning, bins selected size created, instead pooling assemblage data together, one level per time bin selected representative bin. results even number WUs bins similar count size assemblage. However, issue low resolution remains. Therefore, propose new method binning moving window, compromise using individual levels selective binning. method follows simple sequence: time bins created, levels selected selective binning, RoC bins calculated. However, brackets time bin (window) moved forward selected amount time (Z), levels selected (subset bins), RoC calculated new set WUs. repeated X times (X bin size divided Z) retaining results. R-Ratepol currently provides several options selecting WU, namely ndividual levels (Working_Units = \"levels\"), selective binning levels (Working_Units = \"bins\"), new method binning moving window (Working_Units = \"MW\")","code":""},{"path":"https://hope-uib-bio.github.io/R-Ratepol-package/reference/fc_estimate_RoC.html","id":"randomisation","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Randomisation","title":"RRatepol: Estimate rate of change — fc_estimate_RoC","text":"Due inherent statistical errors uncertainties age estimates age-depth assemblage datasets (e.g. pollen counts level; Birks Gordon, 1985), R-Ratepol can run several times results summarised (Steps 5-6).
